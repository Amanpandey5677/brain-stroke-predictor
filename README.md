# brain-stroke-predictor

This project implements a Stroke Prediction System using supervised machine learning models on a health dataset. The data is preprocessed by handling missing values, encoding categorical features, scaling continuous features, and addressing class imbalance using SMOTENC. Multiple classifiers like Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, and Linear SVM are trained and evaluated. Performance metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are computed and visualized. The pipeline also includes detailed EDA and correlation analysis for insights.

âœ… Input Description
The input is a CSV file named stroke_data.csv containing health-related attributes of patients such as:

age, bmi, avg_glucose_level

gender, ever_married, work_type, Residence_type

hypertension, heart_disease, smoking_status

The target variable is stroke (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
